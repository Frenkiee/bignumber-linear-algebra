# Linear algebra for bignumbers

Purpose of this package is to create Vector and Matrix implementation, which will support BigNumbers.
Current logic is based on that assumtion that's why in the first instance of lib we are only allowing those kind of numbers used.

In future we will upgrade both classes to incorporate generic types, which can be manipulated by Vector and Matrix operations.
